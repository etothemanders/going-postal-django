/*This blank css file exists so that I can successfully run 
heroku run python manage.py collectstatic

Heroku was complaining that the goingpostal project directory was missing a dir 
causing the collectstatic command to fail:
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/goingpostal/static'

Tried:
heroku run mkdir goingpostal/static/
But it did not create the empty dir

heroku run python manage.py collectstatic --ignore /app/goingpostal/static
But it did not ignore the goingpostal directory

Seems my heroku cli user does not have permissions to run any those bash commands.
Could not even cd around.
